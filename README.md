# [`@rbxts/react-ts`](https://github.com/littensy/rbxts-react) Example

This is an example of how to use the `@rbxts/react-ts` library.

Some things to note:

-   This example uses [`@rbxts/roblox-react`](https://github.com/littensy/rbxts-react#-reactroblox) and enables strict mode for rendering.
-   React is accessed through an alias, `@rbxts/roact`, to avoid conflicts with Roblox-TS compiler.
